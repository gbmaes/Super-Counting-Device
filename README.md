# Counting device that enables the user to count the numbers they want to. 
By selecting the number they want to start and end with as well the interval number they want to skip.
If the user type "0" in the interval input, a 'ERROR' message will pop up in the window.
If the user type  a lower number than the "Start" input, in the "End" input, the device will count backwards.
The Loop structure was used in the process, among other features.
